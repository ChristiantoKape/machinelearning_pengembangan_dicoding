# Proyek Pengembangan Machine Learning Dicoding
Name : Christianto Kurniawan Priyono

## Submission 1 - Pengembangan Machine Learning NLP
------------------------------------------------------------
### Description
The project was created to implement neural network work in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Additionally, this project is a submission for the [Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning - Proyek Pertama](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/185) course on Dicoding.

### Features
- **LSTM** addresses length dependency issues in word order, enhancing the model's ability to understand and process language context more effectively.
- **Sequential** is employed to tackle and comprehend sequential structures in language, enabling models to process information by considering the temporal relationships between words or tokens in text.
- **Embedding** is used to convert words or tokens in the text into vector representations that can be understood by machine learning models.
- **Tokenizer** functions as a text splitter, separating the text into small units.

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project on Google Colab:
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click on File > Open notebook.
3. Choose the GitHub tab and enter the repository URL: https://github.com/ChristiantoKape/machinelearning_pengembangan_dicoding
4. Select the ```Pengembangan_ML_NLP_Christianto_Kurniawan.ipynb``` notebook.
5. Run each code cell sequentially to train the model and make predictions.

### Learning Evaluation
This submission received 3/5 stars with the following evaluation:
1. It is recommended to set the callback with a minimum threshold of 0.90 to achieve a minimum accuracy of 90% has been **achieved**.
2. Add the **oov_token** argument to the tokenizer with the value <oov>, <unk>, or another option. **The improvement** is by adding the oov_token argument = x.
3. The **tokenizer.fit_on_texts()** method should only be applied to the training data to avoid information leakage from the test data into the tokenization process. **The solution** is to omit tokenizer.fit_on_texts() on the test data.

## Submission 2 - Pengembangan Machine Learning Data Time Series
------------------------------------------------------------
### Description
The project was created to implement neural network work in Data Time Series. Additionally, this project is a submission for the [Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning - Proyek Kedua](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/185) course on Dicoding.

### Features
- **LSTM** addresses length dependency issues in word order, enhancing the model's ability to understand and process language context more effectively.
- **Sequential** is employed to tackle and comprehend sequential structures in language, enabling models to process information by considering the temporal relationships between words or tokens in text.
- **Learning Rate pada Optimizer** determines how much the model parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function, influencing the speed and stability of convergence during the training process.

### Getting Started

## Submission Final - Image Classification Model Deployment
------------------------------------------------------------
### Description
This project is created to develop an ML model for image classification, convert it to TF-Lite format, and enable integration on Android and iOS platforms. Additionally, this project is a submission for the [Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning - Proyek Kedua](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/185) course on Dicoding.

### Features
- **Conv2D Maxpooling Layer**  is employed to extract essential features from input images through convolution operations, specifically by applying filters to identify distinct patterns and features.
